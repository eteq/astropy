What's New in Astropy 2.0?
**************************

Overview
========

Astropy 2.0 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 1.3.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

* `Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3`_
*

In addition to these major changes, Astropy 2.0 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* xxx issues have been closed since v1.3
* xxx pull requests have been merged since v1.3
* xxx distinct people have contributed code

Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3
============================================================

Working with bytestring Table columns (numpy ``'S'`` dtype) in Python
3 has been made more convenient because it is now possible to compare
and set array elements with the natural Python string (``str``) type.
Previously one had to use the Python ``bytes`` type and bytestring literals
like ``b'hello'``.  This change allows working with ASCII data columns
in Python 3 using only 1-byte per character instead of the default
4-bytes per character for the numpy ``'U'`` unicode dtype.  For large
datasets this improves memory performance.

Please see :ref:`bytestring-columns-python-3` for details.  Note that no
change has been made to behavior for Python 2.

.. Note:: This introduces an API change that affects comparison of
     bytestring column elements in Python 3.

No relativistic species by default in cosmological models
=========================================================
For all of the built in cosmological model types (e.g., FlatLambdaCDM)
the default CMB temperature at z=0 is now 0K, which corresponds to no
contributions from photons or neutrinos (massive or otherwise).  This
does not affect built in literature models (such as the WMAP or Planck
models).  The justification is to avoid including mass-energy components
that the user has not explicitly requested.  This is a non-backwards
compatible change, although the effects are small for most use cases.

Convolution has undergone a significant overhaul to make fft and direct
convolution consistent.  They keyword arguments have changed and the behavior
of `~astropy.convolution.convolve` are no longer the same as in versions 1.3
and earlier (however, `~astropy.convolution.convolve_fft`'s behavior remains
unchanged.  The details are given on the :ref:`astropy convolution
<astropy_convolve>` documentation page.
